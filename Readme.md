During the project , I applied some of the machine learning and data science methods that I had learnt till the point of beginning the project. 

I learnt :

- A cool way to visualise things, that is the longitute-latitutde map visualisation.
- Learnt about stratified sampeling 
- Learnt the meaning of pipelining but haven't implemented it yet 

Note:
Pipelning is nothing but doing stuff in one place by puting your methods constructively in formats of classes and functions and implementing it oneshot in the main.
